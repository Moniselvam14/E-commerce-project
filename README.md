Product Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project that provides personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchase history. The system utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate relevant recommendations. This project aims to improve the overall shopping experience for users, increase sales for e-commerce businesses

## Dataset

I have used an amazon dataset on user ratings for Beauty products. To avoid biases,  each product and user is assigned a unique identifier instead of using their name or any other potentially biased information.
